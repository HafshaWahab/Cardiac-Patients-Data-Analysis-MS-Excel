## Background
The "Cardiac Patients Medical Report Analysis" is a comprehensive study focused on gaining insights into cardiac health and efficiency, with the ultimate goal of contributing to medical knowledge, enhancing patient care, and improving outcomes for individuals at risk of heart issues. The study involved a detailed analysis of medical reports from heart patients, to identify the most vulnerable age group, gender predisposition to heart diseases, and the impact of factors such as chest pain, fasting blood sugar, and serum cholesterol. The dataset used for the analysis was sourced from Kaggle.

## Methodology
1) Data Collection
2) Data Cleaning & organisation
3) Data Analysis
4) Conclusion

## Goals
The goals of the analysis included identifying the age group most vulnerable to heart disease in specific countries, evaluating gender-related predispositions, determining the most threatening type of chest pain, and analysing the impact of fasting blood sugar and serum cholesterol in causing cardiac diseases. The study utilized concepts such as data cleaning and analysis, conditional formatting, sorting, pivot tables, and charts to process the data and derive meaningful insights.

## Findings
* The analysis revealed that individuals aged 39-58 years are the most affected by heart diseases.
* Both men and women are equally prone to heart diseases.
* Non-anginal chest pain was identified as the most common type and poses a severe threat to heart attacks.
* The impact of fasting blood sugar on the occurrence of heart diseases was found to be less significant.
* Serum cholesterol was identified as a significant factor in causing cardiac diseases. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing cardiac health, emphasizing the need for proactive measures such as regular health check-ups, lifestyle modifications, and increased awareness to mitigate the risk of heart diseases. The findings underscore the significance of age, gender, chest pain type, and metabolic factors such as fasting blood sugar and serum cholesterol in the occurrence of cardiac diseases, offering actionable recommendations to improve patient care and outcomes.
